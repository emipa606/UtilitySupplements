[h1]Overview[/h1] V1.1

[h1]Application[/h1]

Application of the foam or use of these toxins is handled using multiple delivery methods.

[b]"Sprayer"[/b]: allows the toxins to be directly applied as foam to small areas with control. (Manual process when drafted). The sprayers also have a limited number of uses (indicators provided).

[b]"Mortar Shells"[/b]: The foams and gases can be delivered with shells using mortars.

[b]"IDEs"[/b]: The shells can be used for IED traps. (Note only Insect Killer, Mind Killer, Tangle and Tear Gas IDEs are provided as default, the other types require additional mod support.)

[b]"Foam Poppers"[/b]: Foam poppers can be setup for Blight and Insect foam , trigger is the presence of a hive in the case of insect foam poppers. 

[b]"Grenades"[/b]: Insect Killer, Mind Killer, Tangle Killer and Tear Gas can be weaponised.

Applied foam to a surface will linger for a while and remain active but it will eventually disperse.


[h1]Mod Options[/h1]

Vary base research costs by a percentage level.

The mod includes settings to tweak which plant gases are used and whether a maximum radius at full maturity. Provided in case anyone experiences any graphical performance issues with their hardware. There's also a toggle for Tangleroot creep.

The relative toxicity setting allows you to tweak how effective the various toxins and other active chemicals perform in relation to default values (percentage).


[h1]Mod Compatibility[/h1] *** Subject to Conversion ***

Remote Tech - Some of the IDEs become available for use when this mod is loaded.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2004190331]RimPlas[/url] - Sprayers will use RimPlas instead of Steel in their ingredients.

[h1]Mod Notes[/h1]

Multiple research projects in own tab with bulk recipes as relevant.
