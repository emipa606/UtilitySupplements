# Application


Application of the foam or use of these toxins is handled using multiple delivery methods.

**"Sprayer"**: allows the toxins to be directly applied as foam to small areas with control. (Manual process when drafted). The sprayers also have a limited number of uses (indicators provided).

**"Mortar Shells"**: The foams and gases can be delivered with shells using mortars.

**"IDEs"**: The shells can be used for IED traps. (Note only Insect Killer, Mind Killer, Tangle and Tear Gas IDEs are provided as default, the other types require additional mod support.)

**"Foam Poppers"**: Foam poppers can be setup for Blight and Insect foam , trigger is the presence of a hive in the case of insect foam poppers. 

**"Grenades"**: Insect Killer, Mind Killer, Tangle Killer and Tear Gas can be weaponised.

Applied foam to a surface will linger for a while and remain active but it will eventually disperse.


# Mod Options

The mod includes settings to tweak which plant gases are used and whether a maximum radius at full maturity. Provided in case anyone experiences any graphical performance issues with their hardware. There's also a toggle for Tangleroot creep.
